        <h1>Welcome to my about me page</h1>
        <p>My name is Eric Sadowski. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am currently serving in the Marine Corps Reserves as a Combat Marksmanship Coach, a Joint Fires Observer, and a Field Radio Operator. I also am a volunteer firefighter in the Pawcatuck Fire Department. I am Fire 1 and Hazmat Operations certified. 
	I am always outside when I have the ability to be. I enjoy outdoor activities like fishing, hunting, hiking, and camping. In the winter I spend most of my time skiing.
